# YSC2017

These are the workshop notes for the Young Statisticians Conference Sep 25, 2017. The title of the workshop is "Developing Your Career to Thrive in a Data-rich, Technology-driven, Reproducible Research Environment". And the list of topics is:

1. Reproducible research, for publications, talks, and web sites using Rmarkdown with the R ecosystem. Many journals now require you to submit code to reproduce the results reported in your paper, and this will become the norm over the next few years.  Maintaining a public profile is important for many careers, and new tools using hugo enable web site construction, tincluding blogs. 
2. Why and how to organise data. Concepts of tidy data, and learning to rearrange data will be covered. It is often said that the data cleaning stage, often neglected in statistics education, takes 95% of your time. Being efficient in data handling can allow you to spend more time thinking about the problem to be solved. 
3.  Making effective plots, grammar of graphics, good practices: Mapping data to graphical elements in plots using ggplot2. Simple plots, scatterplots, bar charts, time series, profiles, boxplots. Using cognitive principles to improve plots. Advanced graphics, layering, maps, interactivity: Layering different data sets, drawing maps, exploring model fits, multivariate plots. Simple interactive graphics.
