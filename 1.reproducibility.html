# Your turn

During the day, there will be times when it is helpful to work together with one or two other participants. Take 2 minutes and introduce yourself to your neighbours!

# What we are covering

- Reproducible research, for publications, talks, and web sites
- Why and how to organise data
- Making effective plots, grammar of graphics, good practices

---
# Tools 

- R, RStudio: building a more quantitative world toegther
- git/github: Collaborative project host and version control system
- Rmarkdown: a simple language for typesetting

---
# Why Rmarkdown

- Very simple typesetting language
- Multiple sophsticated output formats
- Sophistication is achieved with accompanying style files
- Keeps code, data and explanations together
- If data changes, re-run to update results

---
# Rmarkdown 

- A shift to writing papers in Rmarkdown, where code is embedded, and data linked. WHY? *Many journals require code and data to be submitted with an article, to verify results as part of the review*
- Homework submissions from statistics classes written and submitted as Rmarkdown. WHY? *Easy to teach, and keeps student work organised*
- Lecture slides can be written in Rmarkdown. WHY? *Classes typically have code underlying the methods explanations so that students can actively learn the techniques.*
- A shift in Honours, Masters and PhD theses to be written in Rmarkdown, helps in preparation for publication, good practice for organising work
- Reports for organisations on data written in Rmarkdown. WHY? *If data is updated, a re-run is all that is required to update the results and report.*
- Web sites: WHY? *need to be dynamic, and have content like blogs*


---
# Key pieces of Rmarkdown

- yaml: Sets up title, author, date, output type, style
- Headings: `#`, `##`
- R code: `{r}`
- Lists: `-`

---
# Papers in Rmarkdown

Take a look at the paper "Calendar-based graphics for visualizing people's daily schedules" with materials available at: https://github.com/earowang/paper-calendar-vis

- Paper is written in Rmd
- Code and data is in directory
- Submit the pdf, and Rmd, for review, and point to github directory

# Thesis 

.pull-left[
Rob Hyndman's [Thesis Format for Monash](https://github.com/robjhyndman/MonashThesis) produces nice pdf document.

It uses bookdown to create the document. 

You need latex to create the pdf. Style file is `monashthesis.cls`.

Write in Rmarkdown. Latex snippets make equations.

# github

is your best friend!

- Github is a service for coducting collaborative projects
- has more control and safety checks than Dropbox and Google Docs
- `git` is the language to interface with github
- it is possible to have private repos
- very supportive of academic research

Resources: Thanks Jenny Bryan! [githug](https://github.com/jennybc/githug); [Happy git with R](http://happygitwithr.com); [First time git setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)

# Let's collaborate

Your overall task for today is to build a guidebook together using bookdown. We'll title it as:

"I reckon ...."

and each of us will contribute a chapter, with a title that finishes the sentence. A chapter can be as little as a paragraph, or a couple of pages, and should contain:

- something that you find useful, important, interesting, ... from the workshop that you think others might also find useful
- it needs to have some R code, maybe some data, that you weave your point around

---
# Let's get started

- I will create a github repo for the guidebook
- I will invite you to collaborate
- You pull a copy of the repo
- You add your chapter, that starts with a tentative title, and a couple of sentences introducing yourself

---
# Getting started with github

From RStudio, start a `New project`, with `Version Control`

![](images/version_control.png)

---
# git project

Make it a `git` project

![](images/git.png)

---
# Connect it to github

And provide the address of the github site, to do a *handshake*, so that your computer registers with the repo


![](images/github_address.png)

---
# Using git


Three commands, in this order, always!
- `commit` register your changes with the repo
- `pull` get the changes from the repo
- `push` your changes back to the repo

---
# Config

The first time you connect, in order to push your changes to the github repo may require that you 

```
githug::git_config_local(user.name = "louise", user.email = "louise@example.org")
```

---
# Making your chapter

Open `02-literature.Rmd` and save as `yournumber-title.Rmd`.

Write a few sentences introducing yourself.

---
# Adding your chapter to the repo

Click on the `git` link in the environment tab. You should see your new chapter as a file that can be added to the repo.

![](images/book_git.png)

---

![](images/book_commit.png)

---
# Getting everyone else's chapters

`Pull` the changes that others have made, before you `push` your changes.


![](images/book_pull.png)

---
# Now push your changes

`Push` uploads your changes to the remote repo

![](images/book_push.png)

# Materials from this workshop

- Download a zip copy of the workshop materials
- Create an R project for this course (separate from the collaborative guidebook project)
- Open the slides for the second section `2.data.organisation.Rmd` in RStudio, and the `html` in a web browser
- Follow along with the slides, and run example code
